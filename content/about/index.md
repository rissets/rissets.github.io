Hey everyone! I'm a software engineer with a serious passion for both software development and the world of AI. My coding journey started back in high school, and I've been hooked ever since. I honed my skills studying Computer Science and Engineering at UDINUS (2020-2023), where I explored everything from web development to machine learning.

These days, I'm leading the backend development team at Orbit. I've also had some awesome experiences, like being a scrum developer for the Research Social Project (Risset Social). There, I got to dive deep into microservices development and testing.

Outside of the coding world, you'll probably find me curled up with a good book or fueling up with a fresh cup of coffee. Speaking of which, feel free to let me know if you ever want to grab a coffee and chat!
