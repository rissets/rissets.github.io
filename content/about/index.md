I'm an AI Engineer at [Pt Bagus Harapan Tritunggal](https://bht.co.id) where I build production AI systems — from face recognition engines with anti-spoofing to agentic policy simulators for government institutions. Previously, I led backend engineering at [Orbit Tech Solution](https://orbitechsolution.com), architecting systems for Web3 platforms, AI golf simulators, and smart farming IoT applications.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science (GPA: 3.7) from [Universitas Dian Nuswantoro](https://dinus.ac.id), Semarang. My coursework spanned machine learning, computer vision, NLP, embedded systems, and software engineering — giving me a strong foundation across the full AI + backend stack.

I'm always open to discussing new ideas and potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out!
