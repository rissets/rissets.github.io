I'm leading the backend development for a challenging and exciting project: a platform for investing in and managing real-world assets (RWAs). We're creating a dynamic marketplace for tokenized assets, spanning diverse categories like agriculture, luxury goods, commodities, and intellectual property. The platform offers intuitive web and mobile apps, integrated with secure crypto payment gateways and a custom CRM. My role is to design the complete backend architecture, which involves tackling complex issues related to both centralized and decentralized systems, especially with the use of crypto currency. It's a deep dive into database design, system flow, and code architecture. Our tech stack includes Django, Python, Postgres, Web3, React, Redis, gRPC, and MetaMask.
