Spearheaded the architecture of a hyper-realistic golf simulator, overseeing the entire system from code infrastructure to ML model deployment. Engineered the core engine using a sophisticated physics engine combined with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to accurately predict ball trajectory and resting position based on player skill analysis.
