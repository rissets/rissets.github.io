I am spearheading Fairway Simulator, a technically challenging project that acts as a game-changer for golfers. My role is to architect the entire system and build its core engine. This involves overseeing everything from the application architecture and code infrastructure to the development and simulation of machine learning models. The app analyzes a player's skills and predicts ball trajectory and resting position with high accuracy, using a sophisticated physics engine combined with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to deliver a hyper-realistic golfing experience.
