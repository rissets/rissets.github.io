Led the end-to-end backend architecture for a pioneering platform for investing in and managing tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Designed and developed a complex hybrid system, tackling challenges in both centralized (Django) and decentralized (Web3) environments to ensure secure and scalable crypto transactions across diverse asset categories like agriculture, luxury goods, and intellectual property.
