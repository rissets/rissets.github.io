As the lead backend developer, I am spearheading the development of a challenging and exciting platform for investing in and managing real-world assets (RWAs). We are creating a dynamic marketplace for tokenized assets across diverse categories like agriculture, luxury goods, and intellectual property. My role is to design the complete backend architecture, tackling complex challenges related to both centralized and decentralized systems, particularly with the integration of cryptocurrency. This involves a deep dive into database design, system flow, and robust code architecture to ensure security and scalability.
