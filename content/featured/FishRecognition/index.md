Architected and trained a custom fish recognition system for KNMP (National Fisheries Management Council), overseeing the complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline. The system classifies fish species from images with high accuracy, enabling rapid identification for regulatory and inventory management purposes. Built a robust data pipeline covering collection, annotation, augmentation, and model training through to production deployment via a Django REST API.
