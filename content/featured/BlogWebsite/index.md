I'm spearheading a technically challenging project called Fairway Golf Engine â€“ a game-changer for golfers. The app analyzes playing skills and predicts ball trajectory and resting position using PINNs, ANNs, and a sophisticated physics engine. My role is to architect the whole system and build the core engine. This means overseeing everything from application architecture and code infrastructure to the development and simulation of the machine learning models.
