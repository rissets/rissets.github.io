Designed and deployed a scalable, enterprise-grade face recognition system for biometric verification. Engineered the core pipeline using state-of-the-art computer vision models including InsightFace for face embeddings, Ultralytics for detection, and MediaPipe for precise landmark detection. Implemented advanced anti-spoofing mechanisms and liveness analysis to ensure highly secure biometric verification, seamlessly served via a robust Django REST API.
