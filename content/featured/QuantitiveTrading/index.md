I developed an AI-driven quantitative trading system designed to provide actionable stock investment recommendations. The system leverages machine learning models to analyze vast amounts of market data, identify patterns, and generate predictive insights. My work involved data processing, model development and training, and building an API to deliver the recommendations to end-users or other trading platforms.
