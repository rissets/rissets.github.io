I'm part of the team developing a Smart Farming App that's revolutionizing agricultural investment. We're connecting investors and farmers through a platform that provides real-time monitoring, reporting, and verifiable results. Think of it as bringing transparency and efficiency to the entire cultivation process. As a backend developer on the project, I'm responsible for designing the architecture for the mobile and admin applications, as well as integrating everything with our IoT devices.
