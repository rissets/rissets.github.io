As a key backend developer, I was part of the team developing a Smart Farming App to revolutionize agricultural investment. The platform connects investors and farmers, providing real-time monitoring, reporting, and verifiable results. I was responsible for designing the backend architecture for both the mobile and admin applications, and for integrating the system with various IoT devices to stream and process live data from the fields, bringing transparency and efficiency to the cultivation process.
